# listOrganizerPython
Code for organizing a list of downloads at work

The user should get a formatted list from a spreadsheet sent from the client, then paste it on the program.

The program reads it without the formatting, removes the duplicates, separates in pre-determined categories then prints it in a formatted spreadsheet from the company. 

It helped our team to save approximately 30 minutes in this proccess that before was performed manually.
